        &gt; I’m a full-stack developer who loves crafting dynamic web
        experiences. From sleek interfaces with TailWind CSS 🎨 to seamless
        state management with React and Redux Toolkit ⚛️. I’m all about making
        the web engaging and fun. I also enjoy creating immersive 3D effects
        with Three.js, Fiber, Spring, and Drei 🎮. When I’m not coding, you’ll
        find me strumming my ukulele 🎶, exploring new tech 🔍, or diving into a
        good book 📚. Let’s build something awesome together!
